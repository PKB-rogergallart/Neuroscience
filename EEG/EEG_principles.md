## Brain waves

Wave | Range 
------------ | -------------
Delta | < 4Hz 
Theta | 4 - 7 Hz 
Alpha | 7 - 14 Hz
Mu | 8 - 13 Hz 
Beta | 15 - 30 Hz

- ERP (Event-Related Potentials): study brain responses time-locked to specific sensory, cognitive and motor events. Amplitude usually lower than background EEG --> several trials + average results to increase SNR
